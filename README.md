# 📚 String Practice Repository 📚

This repository is dedicated to my personal practice and exploration of string manipulation in C (or specify your language if different, e.g., C++, Python, Java).

## 🚀 What's Inside?

You'll find various C programs (or relevant language files) that demonstrate and solve common string-related challenges and concepts, such as:

* String declaration and initialization
* Input and output of strings
* String length calculation
* String copying
* String concatenation
* Character access and modification
* Searching within strings
* Basic string parsing
* (Add more specific topics as you tackle them, e.g., "Palindrome checks", "Anagram detection", "Reverse a string")

## 🎯 Goal

The primary goal of this repository is to solidify my understanding of string operations and to build a collection of reusable string utility functions and examples.

## 🌱 Progress & Learning

I'll be continuously adding new examples and solutions as I learn and practice more. Each file will typically focus on a specific string concept or problem.

## 🤝 Contributions

This is a personal practice repository, so external contributions are not actively sought. However, feel free to clone, explore, and learn from the code!

Happy Coding! 💻
